  spec.description = <<~DESC.strip
    `vv-learn` is the LLM overseer that improves the deterministic
    substrate below. It runs autonomously over recorded `vv-process`
    runs, `vv-decision` aggregates, and `vv-memory` Bronze/Silver
    state — and authors TURNs back through the same rules a human
    curator follows. The LLM is the *author* of the proposal; an
    authorized human is the *committer*. vv-learn earns no
    privileges the human doesn't have.

    v0.1.0 ships the minimum viable round-trip: a
    `Vv::Learn::Program` DSL (`requires:` / `ensures:` /
    `shape.prohibited:`), the `Vv::Learn.run!` entrypoint, a
    `Vv::Learn::Run` AR aggregate root, a model dispatcher that
    wraps the caller's `ctx.sample`, and a hard-refusal pre-flight
    that fails the program **before any token is spent** if a
    `prohibited:` invariant would be violated. The
    `Vv::Learn::Reconciliation` typed surface, `strategies do ... end`
    adaptation guidance, Press-style sub-program recursion,
    `replay!`, the `vv-visualize` review UI integration, and the
    `vv-process` cadence binding wait until 0.2.0+. See
    `docs/plans/PLAN_0_1_0.md`.

    Status: pre-v0.1.0 — path-vendored under the MagenticMarket
    substrate.
